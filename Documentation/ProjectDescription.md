# Senior Citizens Senior Dating Site





Backend: Flask will be our course backend framework. It will handle user registration, authentication, profiles, and matchmaking users with each other. Rest API endpoints will be used for user interactions. 

Database: SQLite will be used as the database. It is serverless and is perfect for development and smaller applications. User profiles, messages, and matches will be stored in tables. 

Security: The website will use HTTPs for secure data transfers. We can also use flask built-in authentication system. Follow CORS policy.
