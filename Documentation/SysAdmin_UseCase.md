Use Case: 

Actors:  
- System Admin  
- Dating Website Backend System

Description:  
A system admin oversees user requests to transfer their profile data from the dating website to a personal backup or a partner application. This includes ensuring that the correct data (personal details, matches, messages, likes) is securely transferred.

Data:  
Userâ€™s personal information, matches, messages, likes, and activity history.

Stimulus:  
User command issued through the account settings page to transfer or export data, triggering the admin to verify and facilitate the export process.

Response:  
Confirmation that the data has been transferred or exported successfully, including any relevant logs or reports for auditing purposes.

Comments:  
The system admin must ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to access and export their data. Security measures, including data encryption and consent verification, must be implemented to protect personal and sensitive information during the transfer process.
